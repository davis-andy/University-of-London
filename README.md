## CSM 010 - Applied Machine Learning 

Machine learning is an important topic in both academia and industry these days. There has been growing interest in the practical side of machine learning. This module focuses more on the practical techniques and methods with Python and Scikit-Learn than on the theories or statistics behind these methods. The module enables students to gain hands-on and practical skills for machine learning-based analytics tasks, use appropriate Python libraries and tools to analyze data and develop the design and programming skills that will help build intelligent artifacts. The module helps students assess the performance of machine learning models and develop a deeper understanding of several real-life topics in applied machine learning, to develop the practical skills necessary to pursue research in applied machine learning.

## CSM 020 - Cloud Computing

There is an emerging computing paradigm called cloud computing wherein IT-related functions (e.g., storage or database, applications) are provided “as a service” to end-users under a usage-based payment scheme, due to economies of scale and advancements in virtualization technology. In such a cloud computing model, end-users can hire virtualized services on the fly based on fluctuating requirements (workload pattern, quality of service expectations, etc.), and, in doing so, they avoid worrying about infrastructure details such as where these resources are hosted or how they are managed. Furthermore, developers with innovative ideas for new Internet services no longer require large capital outlays in hardware to deploy their service or human expenses to operate it: instead of buying and maintaining machines, they can just rent computing cycles that are needed. This offers great benefit to IT companies by freeing them from the low-level task of setting up basic hardware and software infrastructures, thus enabling more focus on innovation and creating business value for their services. It is widely believed that cloud computing is the most significant and disruptive transformation the IT industry has ever undergone. 

An information system or software application “in the cloud” typically consists of a front-end and a back-end. The front end is usually in the form of a lightweight Web or mobile phone program that can be almost as interactive and functional as traditional desktop software. The back-end normally involves heavy-weight batch jobs that harness the power of tens, hundreds, or even thousands of machines to crunch massive amounts of data. The module introduces the concepts of distributed computing systems, scalable infrastructures as well as development and configuration of complex large-scale applications and systems. Students learn how to develop and deploy modern applications on cloud platforms, such as Google Cloud Platform and Amazon EC2. 

Cloud Computing introduces a variety of modern tools and technologies including the use of virtual machines and containers, the configuration of distributed systems, deployment and understanding of operations of NoSQL systems, development of RESTFul services with Python, understanding of DevOps practices and infrastructure as a code and use of big data processing systems such as Hadoop MapReduce and Apache Spark.

## CSM 060 - Information Security

Information security is about protecting information (and information systems) against unauthorized access and tampering. Avoiding security breaches is a high priority for organizations storing and handling confidential data. Large amounts of confidential information are stored in today’s information systems. Breaches of security can have dire consequences for the organizations running these systems, therefore it is very important to manage the risks associated with security-related issues. In recent years the topic of information security has played a bigger and bigger role. Consequently, everyone involved in the management of information systems should have at least some basic knowledge of it.
